    p.
      Like all the best card games, Dead Moon involves a hearty mix of strategy
      and luck of the draw. You look at the cards in your hand for colors and shapes
      that match to the card that was last played.
    p.
      Unlike with other matching games, there are no identical cards in the
      deck. Instead, two cards match by sharing colors, shapes, or both.
    p When you assemble a run of all 16 of your cards, you win!
    p
      em Next, let’s learn how to match cards.

    h4 Matching
    p There are 4 ways for cards to match:
    p Top shapes and colors match -- example: both are blue circles
    p Bottom shapes and colors match -- example: both are red triangles
    p Top shapes match and bottom shapes match -- example: yellow shapes are above red shapes
    p Top colors match and bottom colors match -- example: triangles are above squares
    p
      em Next up: we’ll look at calling a match.

    h4 Calling a match
    p.
      You’ll always be matching your next card to the last card added to your run, which
      is displayed along the top.
    p.
      To play a card, just click on it. The card will either
      disappear from the hand and join the run, or it will fade out and back in again to
      indicate it’s not a match.
    p.
      There’s no penalty for wrong guesses, so feel free to give things a try.
      If you get stuck, click the “Start New Game” button at the top of the page.
    p.
      <em>A tip:</em> As you get used to the matching patterns it can be helpful to play
      the game in demo mode, which makes matches for you.
    p
      em Next, let’s see how demo mode works.
    p

  div(id="instructionsModalFour", class="large reveal-modal", data-reveal)
    h4 About demo mode
    p.
      When you click the “Enter Demo Mode” button, the cards will be dealt in a
      specific sequence. We take care of all the matching for you!
    p.
      If you play each card in order, from the top left to the bottom right, each
      will match to the previous one. This provides an easy way to study the matching
      patterns.
    p To exit demo mode at any time, click the “Start New Game” button.
    p
      em Next: you’re just about finished...
    p
      a(data-reveal-id="instructionsModalThree", class="button small radius previous", href="#") << The basics

    h4 Finish up
    p.
      That’s it! Once the game begins, these instructions will be available to you at any time
      from the top of the page.
    p Remember: it might take you a while to see the patterns, so take your time.
    p
      em Have fun!
